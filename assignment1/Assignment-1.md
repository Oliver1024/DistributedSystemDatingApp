# CS6650 Spring 2023  Assignment 1

### Overview

You are contracted by an insane billionnaire to investigate building a new Internet service that implements a dating service that is totally gender-free and allows user to add short, up to 256 characters,  comments about potential matches. The service is to be known Twinder.

In this first phase you are asked to build a very simple prototype of the client and server. The insane billionaire is very cost conscious and requires a prototype that costs basically nothing to deploy and run. We'll build a client that generates and sends user responses to profiles to a server in the cloud. The server will simply accept and validate requests, and send an HTTP 200/201 response if valid. In following phases, we'll add the processing and storage logic to the server, and send a richer set of requests. 

### Task 1: Implement the Server API

The initial server API is specified using [Swagger](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/IGORTON/Twinder/1.0.0#)

In this assignment you need to implement the POST API for the /swipe endpoint using Java servlets. The API should:

1. Accept the parameters for the operations as per the specification
2. Do basic parameter validation, and return a 4XX response code and error message if invalid values/formats supplied
3. If the request is valid, return a 200/201 response code and some dummy data as a response body

Good simple illustrations of how to handle JSON request payloads are [here](https://edwin.baculsoft.com/2011/11/how-to-create-a-simple-servlet-to-handle-json-requests/) and [here](https://www.baeldung.com/servlet-json-response).

This should be a pretty simple task. Test the servlet API with [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) or an equivalent HTTP testing tools. Deploy your server on (ideally) us-west2 on AWS Academy on an EC2 free tier instance you have created that runs tomcat.

### Task 2: Build the Client (Part 1)

This is the major part of this assignment. We want a multithreaded Java client we can configure to sent /swipe requests to the server and exert various loads on your code.

First you need to get a Java client to call your server APIs. You can generate a client API from the Swagger specification page. Look at:

*Export-Client SDK-Java*

Unzip the client and follow the instructions in the README to incorporate the generated code in your client project.

The generated code contains classes and methods for calling the server APIs.

Write a simple test that calls the API before proceeding, to establish that you have connectivity. The examples in the README and documentation are your friends ;).

To connect to your remote server on EC2 you need to call  ApiClient class methods (hint - setBasePath(...)) . It's recommended to create an instance of `ApiClient` per thread in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issues. You then pass this ApiClient object to your SwipeApi object. Again, look at the constructors for SwipeApi. **(Note - you should never modify generated code !)**

If you don't want to figure out the Swagger client, you can use the [Java 11 HTTP client classes](https://openjdk.org/groups/net/httpclient/intro.html) or the [Apache Java HTTP API](https://hc.apache.org/index.html). They are pretty straightforward to figure out. 

Once you have your client calling the API, it's time to build the multithreaded client fun time!!

#### Data Generation

Your client will send 500K POST requests to your server. For each POST your client needs to randomly choose values for the request. Follow the rules below:

1. swipe - either "left" or "right"
2. swiper - between 1 and 5000
3. swipee - between 1 and 1000000
4. comment - random string of 256 characters

#### Multithreaded Client

This is the fun bit. Your aim is to upload all 500K swipe events to your server *as quickly as possible*. 
To do this, use multiple threads in your client. 

How many threads you choose is completely your decision. For each request a thread sends, it should 

1. generate the values needed for the operation
2. execute the POST
3. wait for the HTTP response code

The server will return an HTTP 201 response code for a successful POST operation. As soon as the 201 is received, the client thread should immediately send the next request until it has exhausted the number of requests to send.

#### Handling Errors

If the client receives a 5XX response code (Web server error), or a 4XX response code (from your servlet), it should retry the request up to 5 times before counting it as a failed request. This probably means your server or network is down, or very overloaded.

Note testing on the College network might trigger firewall rules that block your requests. You may need to do propoer load testing at home, or a coffee shop, or bar, depemding on your state of mind ;)

#### On Completion

When all 500k requests have been successfully sent, all threads should terminate cleanly. The programs should finally print out:

1. number of successful requests sent
2. number of unsuccessful requests (should be 0)
3. the total run time (wall time) for all threads to complete. Calculate this by taking a timestamp before you start any threads and another after all threads are complete.
4. the total throughput **in requests per second** (total number of requests/wall time)

#### Validate results

You should run the client on your laptop. Thus means each request will incur latency depending on where your server resides. By using us-west2, this latency will be pretty low from Seattle. If you have problems with the Oregon region, consider running your client on an EC2 instance located in the same region as your server. 

You should test how long a single request takes to estimate your latency. Run a simple test and send eg 10000 requests from a single thread to do this. Using this latency, you can calculate the expected throughput your client will see with various numbers of threads using Little's Law. Use this to guide your design. Remember tomcat by defualt can execute 200 requests per second, but there's only 1 CPU on a free tier instance. So you may see performance degradtion if load the server too heavily due to excessive context switching.

If your overall throughput for 500K requests is not close to the Little's Law estimate for your test runs, you may have excessive serialization in your client. Experiment with low numbers of client threads (maybe 50-ish) to try and get a feel for your system's performance.

### Task 3: Building the Client (Part 2)

With your load generating client working wonderfully, we want to now instrument the client so we have deeper insights into the performance of the system.

To this end, for each POST request:

* before sending the POST, take a timestamp
* when the HTTP response is received, take another timestamp
* calculate the latency for the request (end - start) in milliseconds
* Write out a record containing {start time, request type (ie POST), latency, response code}. CSV is a good file format. Or you may have enough memory. May ... good luck ;)

Once all phases have completed and all 500K requests have been sent, we need to calculate:

* mean response time (millisecs)
* median response time (millisecs)
* throughput = total number of requests/wall time (requests/second)
* p99 (99th percentile) response time. [Hereâ€™s a nice article](https://www.elastic.co/blog/averages-can-dangerous-use-percentile) about why percentiles are important and why calculating them is not always easy. (millisecs)
* min and max response time (millisecs)

You want to do all the processing of latencies in your client after the test completes. The client should calculate these and display them in the output window in addition to the output from the previous step, and then cleanly terminate.

### Task 4: Plot Performance

You need to plot a graph that shows the average throughput of requests for the period of your test. To do this, create a chart that has:

- x-axis values: unit is seconds, from 0 to test wall time, with intervals of one second

- y-axis values: unit is throughput/second, showing the number of requests completed in each second of the test

You can create the chart programmatically of just dump the values into a spreadsheet and go for your life!

### Bonus Points

A popular alternative to servlets for creating HTTP servers is Spring/SpringBoot. Spring has lots of very clever mechanisms for making it easy to write HTTP methods. As an experiment, deploy a Spring(boot) server on your EC2 instance that implements the POST method and run your fastest client configuration against this server. How does the throughput compare?

## Submission Requirements

Submit your work to Canvas Assignment 1 as a pdf document. The document should contain:

1. the URL for your git repo. *Make sure that the code for the client part 1 and part 2 are in seperate folders in your repo*

2. a 1-2 page description of your client design. Include major classes, packages, relationships, whatever you need to convey concisely how your client works.

3. Client (Part 1) - This should be a screen shot of your output window with your wall time and throughput. Also make sure you include the client configuration in terms of number of threads used and Little's Law throughput predictions.

4. Client (Part 2) - run the client as per Part 1, showing the output window for each run with the specified performance statistics listed at the end.

5. The plot  of your throughput over time

### Problems with GSON import in .war file in Intellij

Sometimes there's an issue building the GSON jar file into a servlet, such that when the servlet is deployed it fails because GSON is missing.

Try adding the gson jar to your project from the [Maven website](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson)

For IntelliJ you also need to:

1. Go to project structure
2. choose the artifacts tab
3. select the gson maven package and put it into the lib directory of the artifact.

Compile and deploy ... and cross your fingers and toes!!

### Random number generation in Java Threads

Worth a read for [random number generation](https://plumbr.io/blog/locked-threads/shooting-yourself-in-the-foot-with-random-number-generators) in your client ;)

### Connection management with Apache HttpClient

Your client threads want to keep a connection open and send many requests. Check out this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30889984/whats-the-difference-between-closeablehttpresponse-close-and-httppost-release) to delve into the complexities of how to do it properly.

## Calculating Percentiles Using Histograms

You can calculate approximate percentiles efficiently using histograms. Google around - there are lots of sites that explain the approach. I haven't tried [this implementation](https://github.com/IBM/HBPE/blob/master/README.md), but it sounds promising.
